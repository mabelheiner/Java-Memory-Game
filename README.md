# Java-Memory-Game
# Overview

This project is a simple, five level Java Memory game. It keeps track of how many guesses the user took to make all the matches in the table. To win a level, one must match within a certain number of guesses.

I started this project 2 weeks ago. My goal for creating this is to understand the Java language, especially how it works with object oriented programming.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used the tool replit.com to make this code. It is useful because it is an online editor and you can edit and code anywhere with an internet connnection.

I used the Java language to create this game. The imports: Scanner, Arraylist, and Random were key to creating this program. The Scanner allowed me to read in user input. The arraylist allowed me to use an array to store the board in. The random operator allowed me to generate a new board with different matches each time.

# Future Work

* Make the board adjustable, like 5X5 or 6X6
* Add a timer
